## Overview
The classic **Battleship** game has been brought to life with React! This project was built following the principles of Test-Driven Development to ensure robust and error-free code. Before writing any functional code, all necessary tests were created using **Jest**, making the development process highly structured and reliable.

This project is part of my portfolio and showcases my ability to:
- Write clean, testable code.
- Implement frontend features using React.
- Follow TDD practices for building reliable applications.

## Features
- **Interactive UI**: Drag and drop ships onto the grid.
- **AI Opponent**: Play against a computer with a simple AI.
- **TDD Workflow**: All features tested with Jest.
- **Game Mechanics**: Accurate representation of Battleship rules, including:
  - Ship placement validation.
  - Turn-based gameplay.
  - Hit and miss tracking.
  - Victory condition detection.
